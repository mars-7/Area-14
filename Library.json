It wasn’t obvious, but you could almost feel yourself shivering with excitement. \n      The Entrant, almost in shock, turns to meet your gaze. Shakily, they nod.\n      “Well then,” You say, almost half-smiling.\n      “May I spectate?",

She received a promotion last week, and finally got the time to do her first test on SCP-151. She had prepared this test so carefully, involving SCP-714 to hopefully prevent her Class-D from suffering the same faith as those before him.\n\nClaire walks with the escorting Security Personnel through the Light Containment Zone. The somewhat maze-like design always confused her. Suddenly, with a loud bang, one of the guards falls to the floor. The other guard pulls Clair behind a corner and starts shooting around it. While reloading, he shouts, “Knife Cut!” into the radio and tells Claire to run. And so she does, leaving the gunfire behind her.\n\nGunfire chases her through the facility. Claire hurries into ScD spawn to stay safe. As the doors close behind her, the gunfire comes closer quickly before fading away. They’re here. Claire stares at the door, hoping it will hold. Distant gunfire lets her know help won’t reach her soon. Then, as Claire feared, the door opens. “You, with me.” a figure in the doorway says.",

You know I hate talking about that thing. And I don’t care if it has a name, regardless of whether or not the Foundation gave it one.” “Look, I know you don’t like talking about it, but we seriously need to start conducting tests on it if we want any chance of moving it out of here.” “That’s my problem with it. It will keep growing with no sign of stopping, and there’s nothing we’ve been able to do to stop it. Think about it for a second; there is a literal, full-blown, miniature black hole in this facility, contained in a chamber right below us. And it’s getting bigger by the second.” “Well, it technically isn’t a black hole, since it doesn’t actually have a gravitational for-” “I don’t care what it technically is! Or why it’s here, or what it wants, or anything! Let me remind you that that thing is constantly growing. In 2 centuries, it was going to be a kilometer wide, and that’s only if it doesn’t speed up its process. In 200 years, we’re going to have to deal with a giant, immovable black hole that completely deletes anything it touches. You can’t tell me the thought alone doesn’t scare you.” “Yes, indeed, it’ll eventually be that big, but it’s important to remember that this will happen in hundreds of years, or even more. There’s no way we’d be around to see it even grow to the size of a bus. And that’s considering that we won’t get killed by any of the other things here. Plus, technology will be a lot more efficient than ever, so maybe we’ll find a way to move or stop it by then.”\n\n“I guess you’re right. Still, I’m hoping we can find something ASAP. It’s becoming harder for me to sleep at night because of that thing.” “The team can relate to that… Oh, I almost forgot to mention, High Command has assigned our team to SCP-094. They want us to see if we can try communicating with it, what with it being able to say things.” “They want us to communicate with a black hole?” “Again, it’s technically not a black hole, but yes. It’s not the most farfetch’d thing I’ve seen High Command assign teams to, though. Either way, we ought to get started. The team and I will be in its chamber by the time you finish lunch.” “Alright.

An MD personnel was tending to someone with a large gash on her leg. EC members telling everyone to stay calm. Dr. Hutchinson, however, was all by himself as he ran through the halls of the HCZ.\n     It's all your fault...all your fault…\n     Dr. Hutchinson’s inner thoughts plagued him with guilt as he continued sprinting. The site was suddenly a labyrinth, impossible to navigate compared to when he was focused and could think properly. A test which he has been waiting for months to do. A test that had to go through multiple levels of high command, declaring their permission status. A test gone horribly wrong, all thanks to him. He continued opening doors with his keycard, trying to find a way out of the maze of a site. Breathless, he sat down against a wall and wept. All of the MTF guarding his test fled to find the SCP. The CD was, of course, dead. He was alone. Alone. Alone.\n     Until he looked up and saw a small black speck on the floor. No, not a speck, a blob. It continued to expand, taking up half of the hallway. Suddenly, the realization hit him. He quickly shot up, throwing his clipboard to the side and frantically running away from the growth. And then he's not running anymore, he's on the floor, he tripped. Dr. Hutchinson turned around and saw the body of the SCP rising out of the black. It looked old, decomposed, dark. Terrified, he awkwardly backed away, until he felt a strong, cold grip on his ankle. He let out a scream as it began dragging Dr. Hutchinson toward the black mass. He reached his arms out, trying to find something to grab. But there was nothing. And although Hutchinson’s cries were loud, nobody heard. There was nothing left he could do now.\nThe last thing he saw was a flickering light above his head before he plunged into darkness.",

Mindlessly staring at the white flashes of blinding light originating from the computer screen, scrawling up my newest report, sensing the scolding coffee smouldering away at my mouth and the frigid keyboard below my fingertips. This was no way to live, yet it was what I, and countless other members did. Tonight was dissimilar, though. \n\nStrangely enough, the customarily congested, bustling computer laboratory was almost utterly desolate, other than me, with my screen blasting light into the Vantablack coloured abyss surrounding me. It was as destitute as a freezing winter in Antarctica, yet I couldn’t feel it. I was determined to write my report, regardless of whatever event occurred, as if it was my only goal in life. The coffee could only work for so long, before the drifting sensation of sleep settled in. \nA glossy filter covered my eyes as I pulled myself off the hard, bitterly cold floor noticing my ragged, torn clothes accompanying maroon stains scattered around my body. My eyes clearing up, I crawled over to the fragmented printer across the hallway. It felt like a lifetime to make the journey across the thousands of acute glass shards, slashing through the frail fibres of my lab coat. Wrenching open the tray, I grasped the acrid, moist paper inside. I covered up my wounds and applied pressure to them, using it like a makeshift bandage. My eyes make a beeline towards a display window in front of my desk. It was completely decimated, with a dim, pitch-black tunnel leading into it. Several questions skimmed through my mind at light speed. \n\nWhatever the hell happened while I was asleep? Why was nobody else in the laboratory when I was writing my report? Could have it been a raid? I had to investigate. Scavenging around for a flashlight, a dizzying, nauseous sensation overcame me. I must have lost a hell of a lot of blood. Smashing the glass with it’s plastic hammer, I snatched an emergency kit off the wall and foraged through it, the soft fabric almost comforting me. I was never ready for this, but if I kept waiting, there’s no telling what would happen. The crude shaft, begrimed and murky seemingly went on forever, as if time had paused the second I entered. A macabre, morbid atmosphere enveloped me. The gushing sounds of muddy, odious water dribbled down around me, causing the once industrial white colours of my coat to be overcome with cedar brown. My footsteps, cantering around, was my only company. Every part of me quivered as I traversed forward. \n\nThen it happened. I got what I asked for. A blinding, fiery light materialised at the end of the shaft, into the once modern, high-security containment zone, which was wrecked by blazes illuminating the corridors, corroded metal blemished the walls like vines on an abandoned building left to rot. As if I had wiped away the frost on a window, it became clear. If only I wasn’t so damn determined to write that report.",

Distant gunfire and screaming echoes down over and over, perpetually taunting those that had stood against what caused the massacre. The Foundation Personnel quarters bustled quietly, most of the survivors were dwelling within there, however, it is not noise it sought, the encroaching death scraped closer and closer, they could not see it behind the door, but the agonising noise of the concrete growing closer broke the minds of the fragile.\n\nThe door bursts open.\n\nThe room was silent. The onyx mist of darkness covered the statue, the survivors damn the thumping of their heart betraying them, and like a shadowed hand, it swept through the quarters. Mercilessly, but efficiently.

Gas masks hid their experienced snarl towards the anomaly, they both glanced towards each other before approaching it.\nIt glared... Perpetually.

As the deafening noise of scraping metal penetrates the lobes of their ears, their worried voices silenced by a crunch, and a faint bang of their bodies colliding with the floor.\nThe halls turned a blind eye to the massacre.

Noticeably battered, it seemed, with its chipped edges and coffee stains. Your own clipboard was new—hardly touched, barely used. You chuckle to yourself. \n“Thank you.”\n\n\tCRACK!\n\nYou hear the sound clearly. The MTF at the scene had heard it many times before and were almost numbingly staring back at you, as though waiting for a signal that the test was concluded. In the heat of the moment, you peer over the edge, seeing the test subject’s lifeless body lying on the floor. Looming on top of them, 173 stood motionless, a statue as still as the world itself.\n\n\tYou feel your heart beat faster.\n\n\t“No!”\n\nThe test subject crumbles to your feet, the death swift as it had always been. The first time was the hardest, your breath shaky as their dead body fell to the floor, hopeless screams ringing throughout the chamber.\n\nYou were an Assistant now. Part of that meant ignoring their pleas for mercy.\n\n\t“Congratulations.”\n\nThe Assistant Researcher greeted you with a scorn, crossing their arms as they faced you. You had almost forgotten, then, that you had been promoted. It was strange to no longer be called an assistant with the rest of them.\n\nHow does it feel?” \nThey asked, staring longingly at you. \n“You’ve won the fight. You’ve become a Researcher.”\n\nYou had worked hard for the position, of course. Everyone did, to the point that you being one of the 20 hand-picked spots felt almost unreal. You smile back at them.\n “Like I deserved it.”\n\n“So many reports!”\n\nOne year you’ve been in the position, yet the overwhelming amount of test reports never seemed to go away. You slam your head onto your desk. 20 more reports to look at, and with you as the only Senior available, it felt like too much work for so little reward. It was at that moment, suddenly, that an idea popped into your head.\n\nYou spectated a test for the first time in months. The Junior at the time was clearly scared, but that didn’t matter. Even in their anxiety, you could feel their excitement, driving to get better and achieve more. That was enough.\n\nThe Assistant was much more at ease, calmly instructing test subjects, and promptly executing each task. You remembered yourself as an Assistant---the nostalgia was almost overwhelming.\n\nThe Researcher clearly knew how to test, and by now, they had experienced almost every possible failure to understand what could go wrong—and what could go right. That confidence was something you barely had time for ever since you became a Senior, and seeing it first-hand was almost a realisation.\n\n\tIt was settled, then.\n\nYou walk to the TSTA, each step heavy as they hit against the concrete floor.

Okay, first of all, welcome to the Foundation's Scientific Department, I'm sure all of you are at the top of your fields.\"\n\n\t\"Yes? A question? You in the back. No, you don't get to interact with the anomalies yet. I'm sure all of you are anxious to have an encounter with an SCP but allow me to be the first to tell you that anomalies are not some strange trinket, they act seemingly outside the laws of any of your PhDs, so I suggest you listen closely unless you do not enjoy being alive.\"\n\n\t\"Any takers? No one? Good.\"\n\n\t\"First of all, let's go over your job as researchers. You are to test anomalies in an attempt to understand how they function. I assume you all have taken a look at the clearance manual and guidelines? Good. Too many violations, and you'll be meeting a slick orange jumpsuit and a cold, hard cell. Speaking of which, Class-D, they are ex-cons and are not to be trusted. If you think you've found a good one, then you're dead wrong.\"\n\n\"Now, since I don't want your first anomaly experience to be in a testing environment, I brought one with me, Let me get it…\"\n\n\"Ah, here it is. This is SCP-662, and from the looks on a few of your faces, I assume that some of you already know what this anomaly does. Wait for a moment.\"\n\nA suited man enters the room.\n\n\t\"Great! Hello Mr. Deeds,\" \n\n\t\"Hello Mr. Bright, how may I be of service?\"\n\n\t\"Mr. Deeds, would you fetch me a piece of solid gold? Now, we wait for a moment.\"\n\nThe suited man leaves for a moment and comes back a few minutes later and hands him the bar of gold.\n\n\t\"Ah, thank you, Mr. Deeds. I no longer require your services.\"\n\n\t\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n\t\"Now, would anyone like to tell me how any of their PhDs could explain that? Hm, silence, Interesting. \"\n\n\"Okay, I know that sometimes the Foundation's meaning can get lost in the endless shuffle of papers, so I'll use an analogy to explain containment classes to you. Think of the Foundation's containment as a hole in the ground. For a safe class anomaly, you'd just set it in that hole; for a Euclid, you would bury it; for a Keter, you would bury it with cement and put a cover over it. Thaumiel can as well be a hole. Neutralised means it's not active, and therefore does not need to be put in a hole.\"\n\n\tThe Code Red Fox alarm engages noisily across the site; facility broadcaster warns the site's occupants of an occurring breach.\n\n\t\"Ah, yes, perfect timing!

It heals around 1/5 of a person’s health per vial. MDs are allowed to take this vial out of the medbay.\n\nSedative Vial\nOne of the most infamous vials, it rose to fame after it was broken for more than a year (it’s still broken), and Trial Nurses kept using it on CD because they could pick it up for some reason. Those above the rank of Practitioners are able to use it. As mentioned in the health vial section, it is light blue. Remember, the normal blue is good, light blue is dangerous. It is supposed to slow you down a bit; however, right now, it stops you from moving.\n\nStamina Vial\nThe stamina vial; the polar opposite of the sedative vial. It is commonly used to reset the speed of affected personnel. Those above the rank of the Resident can use it. The vial itself is green. When used on a person, it will cause their speed to increase exponentially. The effects are temporary. It can be used to reset the speed of a CD.\n\nBlindness Vial\nThe blindness vial is very clear in its function. Residents and above can use it. The liquid inside of the vial is black, like your vision after it is used on you. When used, it will blind the subject temporarily. It can be used to reset the vision of a CD. This vial is allowed to be taken from the medbay but can only be used in self-defense.\n\nTime Processing Skills Vial\nThis is one of the more eccentric vials. It is available to MD above Physician, and the vial is pink-purple. The effects of the vial, however, are much more interesting. Those affected by this vial will be able to move around freely while their body stays in one place. \n\nPoison Vial\nThe poison vial is exactly what it sounds like. It is only used by Principal Doctors and above. The vial color is orange, like orange juice. But it’s not orange juice. When affected by the poison vial, your health will slowly deplete until you are left at one health. If you are already damaged, you will die.\n\nIn conclusion, MD vials are quite fun. Join MD if you want to learn the ways of the vial. \nPlease just join MD.",

    "content": "Along with frequent checkups, the Medical Department will also conduct medical tests from time to time as part of their duties. When a member reaches the rank of Resident, they unlock the privilege to test on a limited number of SCPs; with that number increasing for each rank, they advance. \nIn many ways, these tests are very similar to the tests the Scientific Department conducts regularly. However, there are a few key differences that make this perk unique to the Medical Department and its members. Due to the Medical Department members not being as qualified to conduct tests on anomalous objects, their testing options are limited compared to the Scientific Department. Even the few SCPs that can be tested on do require relatively high ranks to unlock the ability to test on said objects. \nHowever, the few tests that are conducted are critical to the Medical Department's duties. As an MD progresses through the ranks, they unlock the ability to test on SCP-999, SCP-407, and SCP-409. All three of these SCPs have significant medical potential, and thus are an excellent fit for the Medical Department's testing. \n\n____________________________________________________\n\nTests conducted by Medical Department members will generally revolve around medical aspects to fit the department's overall theme. When a member is doing a test, they will often watch the health of their subject to see the effects an SCP may apply to them. Often, these tests will include medical vials that members unlock through their natural progression through the ranks. These vials will affect the health of subjects in various ways and push the SCP to its natural limits. This will allow a member to see what an SCP would do in environments that are generally not achievable. Whether the tests use vials or not, they will always be distinct to the Medical Department.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nAlong with the occasional test, Medical Department members will assist the Scientific Department in their tests from time to time. The vast majority of this will be the Medical Department member bringing a vial that the Scientific Department member could otherwise not access. This key teamwork advances both department's ability to test and is a great way for our knowledge of these SCPs to advance. All in all, medical testing is very important to the Medical Department and its contributions to the Foundation. These tests pose as a vital tool in learning about the nature of SCPs and their anomalous effects. The tests conducted are unique from any other test. However, the tools that are unique to Medical Department members can be effectively used by Scientific Department members in their experiments. This important cornerstone of the department will be used by hard-working members to further their knowledge and the knowledge of the Foundation as a whole. It will be vital for the Department and Foundation's present and future.",

    "content": "The Medical Bay is the most important place for the Medical Department’s members to be. We conduct most of our duties inside the several rooms located there. As new members of MD (or just The Foundation in general) may be overwhelmed by the number of doors and rooms located there, I hope this guide will make the Medical Bay easy to remember and clear up any questions staff members had.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n“The Infirmary ”\n\nAs most people know, this is where checkups are regularly hosted by Medical Department members. All three (3) types of checkups (Standard, Physiological, and Psychological) are able to be conducted here. It is the door directly to the left of when you enter the Medical bay. The room consists of seven (7) “examination rooms.” Each of these contains a Bed, Scale, Eye Chart, Terminal, Chair, Sink, Monitor, and Side Table. There are also curtains located at the open area in front of these rooms that are able to be closed and opened.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n“Surgery”\n\nSadly, this room has no current use (even though one time I did do “surgery” on O5-10.) The doors to the Surgery rooms are direct to the right once you enter the Medical Bay. Once you open those doors, it leads to a very small hallway. There are then a set of two identical rooms. Both of these rooms include a surgery bed, three cabinets, a terminal, and a side table next to the bed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n“Isolation”\n\nUnlike surgery, this room has some purposes. It is mainly used for speed correction from our and ScD’s tests, but may also be used for Psychological Checkups. It is the single sliding door farthest from the entrance to the Medical Bay. The room is in a T-shape, with four (4) “Quarantine Rooms.” These rooms are very similar to The Infirmary’s examination rooms. Every room contains a Bed, Terminal, Chair, Small Cabinet, and a side table with an oxygen tank and heart monitor.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n“Reception”\n\nThis is the only room visible from just standing inside the Medical Bay. It’s where our vials and charts are kept. Inside the left cabinet are health vials and all three sets of charts. Inside the right cabinet are all our other vials. From top to bottom, the order of vials is Sedative, Poison, Blindness, Time Processing Skills, Stamina, then another group of Health. On top of the counter are two terminals.",

    "content": "A Tale from a Medical Department member, flietje_kalamel\n\n---\n\n\nIt’s Saturday night, 21:39 PM. A Resident is about to observe his superior conducting a test. \n‘Requesting two Class-D personnel and two security guards at TSTA-2.’ Requested the superior confidently. Immediately, the Resident wanted to spectate. His superior swiftly complied and agreed to have him. The Resident was filled with joy, he’s never seen an MCZ test before. When both of the Class-D were in line, one Guard immediately started briefing the subjects. The way this guard was treating the subjects, didn’t seem right at all to the Resident. The subjects all replied accordingly, understanding the rules.\n\nSaturday night, 22:24 PM. Personnel involved with the test moving to the checkpoint, estimated time of arrival, 22:30 PM.\n‘So, what do you do for a living?’ Class-D-A asked full of energy. ‘I perform checkups on all personnel of the facility, including you.’ Said the Resident. ‘That’s so cool!’ said Class-D-A ‘Do you have a name?’ ‘My name is Jamal.’ The Resident responded and then said: ‘How about you? What’s your name?’ ‘Mine’s Isaak, but friends refer to me as D-8124. The other Class-D is Omar, since he’s been abducted he’s been afraid of everything, silly guy right?’ Said Class-D-A. ‘Silence back there, or I’ll fill your body with lead!’ Ordered the Guard viciously.\n\nSaturday night, 23:12 PM. All personnel successfully arrived at SCP-409, 606 missing.\n‘Listen up, Class-D’ Charlie spoke in a clear tone ‘I want you to enter this room, standing in the corners, diagonally from each other, any questions?’ Omar was wondering what this SCP does. The escorting operative replied with: ‘None of your business. Do as instructed or face death.’ Omar was furious by the way these guards treated him. As the guard came closer, he readied his hidden knife and stabbed him in the neck. The operative, distracted with Omar quickly met his fate as Isaak stabbed him in his stomach. The final guard cowards away and surrenders. ‘Consider yourselves to be our hostages!’ said Isaak. ‘Good thing they didn’t see through our disguise.’ Laughed Omar victoriously.\n\nSunday morning, 00:14 AM. The Class-Ds and the hostages are roaming around the MCZ.\n‘You said this was the way out!’ shouted Isaak at the remaining guard. ‘It is, it is! Don’t hurt me please!’ begged the guard. As things couldn’t get worse, they did. ‘Something bright is coming through the walls, Isaak!’ screamed Omar. ‘Let’s get out of here man, I don’t want to get hurt!’ Isaak replied. As 606 shifted through the walls, he began to immediately ‘’enlighten’’ the guard. Charlie, obviously in distress, asked for help. No one came, and 606 began to ‘’enlighten’’ the Resident’s superior. The Resident, who was about to meet his fate, remembered that the guard had a radio. While trying to crawl away, the Resident begged for help on the guard’s radio. And finally, at the moment 606 was catching up, MTF arrived and safely dragged the Resident to a safe and remote location.",

The last checkup was just finishing up in the medbay.\n\n\t\"Alright, thank you for coming!\"\n\n\tThe practitioner was exhausted. But it had been worth it. It had been his first physiological checkup. He still had yet to inspect the sedative vial, especially because he had heard that the current batch was…weird. That was tomorrow, though. He was going to end the night by heading to OBS and watch some CDs. After all, his idol, KreeperKid299 had invited him to some coffee there.\n\n\tThe practitioner closed the lights in the lobby and was heading up the stairs, when a researcher appeared at the top. He had never understood the importance of the Scientific Department. Whatever, “science” they did could never compare to the work at the Medical Department. Sure, the containment measures they develop MIGHT prevent one or two breaches, but the amount of breaches that are CAUSED by those tests can not even be counted. And why not try to prevent those sleeping SDs from letting the CDs into the CZs. \n\n\tThat thought quickly faded when he saw the metal CD, clanking along at a snail’s pace. \n\n\t“Oh god, how can I help?” The practitioner scrambled to help the group into the lobby. Perhaps, he might be able to try the sedative vial after all.\n\n\t“We’re going to need a stamina vial,” the Researcher spoke.\n\n\t“Ok, I got y-” the practitioner began, “Oh wait, I don’t have permission, sorry.” The researcher didn’t seem to understand. \n“I’m sorry?”\n“I can’t use the vial.”\n\t“Alright, in that case.” The researcher signaled for the SD to terminate the CD, when the practitioner remembered something.\n\n\t“WAIT!” The practitioner nearly shouted, fumbling for the radio, but the CD had already tumbled to the ground, with more lead than was already there.\n\n\t“Kreeper to the MD lobby-” the practitioner sighed under his breath.",

Even if she knew her place at the reception desk was, more often than not, crucial due to the lack of available personnel, she craved a distraction—something to focus on, beyond paperwork and the rare wounded guard.\n\nSo she stood here now, in front of one-armed escort and a scanner. Her and the test subjects had already gone through, groggy and bitter, but still excited for SCP-999. It was a secure SCP, one that didn’t require much thought or a curious mind, but she hoped it would make the CDs happy. She could only imagine their boredom within the TSC, among hard beds and quiet murmur.\n\nShe could only imagine how it felt to be a prisoner.\n\nTheir arrival to LCZ’s vast hallways is quick and precise, and the security guard is speaking to her - smiling, cheerful - when all of a sudden, the floor is surging upwards. Her mind blurs for a second, and someone pulls at her hair. There’s noise, gunfire, the collision of armor, and the glint of a gleaming knife. The man she was speaking to moments before gasps now, clutching at his bare neck, and she pretends not to see the ruddy red between his gloved fingers. Doesn’t watch him stagger or struggle for the radio at his chest, staring down at her when someone hauls her back. The hiss of a venomous and hateful voice whisper into her ear before she can even utter a word.\n\n“Say one thing, miss, and you’ll be full of lead before you finish.” One CD sneers, and waves a Glock quite clearly in her face before pointing it up to the guard. “Don’t wanna end up like him, don’t ya?”\n\nShe breathes in, withering and ragged, and prepares to let out a scream - but she quiets when a bullet goes off and her escort gurgles, falling to his knees. There’s a pool at her fingertips now, her own crimson reflection observing her.\n\nShe desperately tries not to notice anything else - how the guard, with his trembling arm reaching out to her, offers her his radio in a desperate bid for safety above her head. She only sees her own eyes and the deep blue within them. The ocean of tears is unshed.\n\n“Take her down to the furthest chamber,” somebody in the distance says, just as the guard collapses to the metal floor, “hide her before anybody notices.”\n\nHer vision is hazy, and her ears are ringing.\n\n“We’ll be the ones testing tonight.”\n\n━━ εïз ━━\n\nA tale brought to you from a member of the Medical Department, Yukova",

Although you’re being held at gunpoint, you remain calm as this has happened multiple times before. “A-a-alright.” you tell the loose inmate in a startled tone as an attempt to deceive them. They turned around to open the door but you quickly applied a Blindness vial which caused them to scream in confusion and frantically shoot their gun. You fled to Zone-D checkpoint but the blind CD was able to hit you once which decreased your health by a bit. \nYou safely made it past the Zone-D checkpoint where you stopped for a quick break. As you were about to leave, the doors opened and 3 armed CDs entered Zone-B. All 3 of them yelled “HOSTAGE!” simultaneously. You felt your heart skip a beat as you realised that you didn’t have any more Blindness vials nor a firearm to protect yourself. You stood in shock, feeling extremely vulnerable. One of the CDs yelled “HOSTAGE!” again before shooting at the wall behind you. You felt yourself profusely sweating and trembling. The stress had caused you to impulsively run to the med-bay. Fortunately, Security Sentinels Amanokuo and andrewramirezlol were there to terminate the loose CDs. However, during the process you were accidentally shot due to crossfire. Your health bar was practically empty after all of that. \nYou made your way to med-bay but upon entering, you were greeted by an armed and affected CD. Just like the previous CDs, they also demanded you to be their hostage.You had no choice this time. You were one shot away from death so you were forced to follow their orders. “BEHIND THE COUNTER!” the CD ordered. You couldn’t think of what to do next as stress and anxiety had fully corrupted your mind. The CD then demanded you to make an announcement on the radio. Before activating the radio, you realised that you were within reach of the button to close the bulkhead. You then jumped to the wall and immediately pressed the button which promptly lowered the bulkhead.They then started shooting the bulkhead out of frustration which gave you time to announce on the radio that you were being held hostage. SRU immediately responded to your cry for help and within a few seconds, you heard multiple deafening shots. After a couple more seconds, the door swung open. Upon exiting the reception area, you see the CD’s body laying on the ground. “Microblock is a bit of a troublemaker aye?” says the SRU. After his body disappeared, you thanked them and then went to the infirmary bed at the end of the room where you closed the curtains behind you and layed down on the bed.

Checking the time, he sighed, “11 PM.” With his fingers running through his soft, brown hair, he packed up his belongings and headed off for the night. Strangely enough, he felt as he was being watched. This was normal during the day, but this night it felt different to him. Like someone was there this time. Near the cafeteria, he suddenly stopped, realizing he forgot the SCP-409 report. He walked back to the Medical Bay in his classic cheerful way. His face quickly turned from happy to confused and creeped out. The SCP-409 report was on a side table next to a bench. He picked up and read the sentence written on a sticky note. “I heard you forgot this, so here you go.” Dr. Kreeper was completely freaked out, as this proves he was being watched; maybe even stalked. He thought to himself, “Am I going crazy? Is there someone watching me? What do I do?” All the questions cycled through his head. He decided that getting sleep may be the best thing to do for now. Continuing his walk to the living quarters, a shadowy aura started to form around his body. It seemed to slowly come out of the SCP-409 report and consume his energy, as he got slower and slower, and sleepier and sleepier. He eventually passed out, collapsing on the ground. The Shadow stole his keycard, vials, and the report it came out of. Off it went into the night, never to be seen again. The Doctor slowly faded away...\n\nDr. Kreeper looked around. He was in some sort of dream world. He walked around, trying to grasp what just happened. So many questions, not enough answers. Eventually, he came upon a towering building with the same aura that sucked him into this place. It seemed to be drawing him in, closer and closer. He soon found his hand on the red heavy door. Trying to pull with all his might, he eventually got in. Once inside, The Shadow lifted him up in the air, bringing him up all the several thousand floors. He felt like throwing up after looking how high up he was. The Shadow slowed down as they approached the top floor. “What’s going to be up there?” Dr. Kreeper thought to himself. “I probably won't be good, so I’ll just hope for the best.” They had arrived. What laid before his eyes was a large, scarlet, throne. It looked as if it was made from human flesh and bones. There was a black haired woman sitting on it. Her hair was The Shadow. After looking at Dr. Kreeper for what felt like hours, she whispered, “Bye,” as he fell into the void, bringing him back to the real world. Once back, he didn’t know what to do but sit on the ground and stare at a wall. “This isn’t good,” he said minutes later, eventually going to the living quarters. This thing was now in the real world. The Shadow was after the Foundation, now and forever.\n",

My name is Piefan11, a Principal Doctor. We are tasked with the healing of Foundation Personnel and performing checkups/testing on Class D personnel. The Medical Departments’ goal is to make sure people get good physical, mental, and cognitive states for both FP and CD. Being in the Medical Department grants you many privileges! We are a very diverse department, and no one judges anyone based on their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, physical or mental disability, or age. In short, we accept all.\n\nRight. So, the principal thing that we do here is doing checkups. Testing on SCPs is something that you can do when you reach the Practitioner rank. For now, you need to attend a Trial Nurse Training so you can do a checkup without supervision. All of this information I’m telling you is also in the Medical Guidelines. If you want to do a checkup right now while waiting for a TNT, please inform a Principal Doctor and we will arrange a time for you. Speaking of that, for every checkup you do, we give out stars. Stars are used for promotions.\n\nOkay. Moving on. Here at MD, we have eight ranks. Specialists in Charge, Specialists, Principal Doctors, Physicians, Residents, Practitioners, Nurses, and Trial Nurses. To be promoted to Nurse, attend a TNT. To be promoted to Practitioner... read the guidelines and it will tell you! As you already know you from our Introductory Sessions, we have six vials. Health, Sedative, Stamina, Blindness, Time Processing Skills, and Poison. We only allow trial Nurses to have the Health vial, but you can get a state-of-the-art medkit when you get Nurse! Unlimited heals! No coming back to the Infirmary! Well, unless you die.\n\nNow that’s out of the way. People underestimate our impact here at the Medical Department. A few SDs even call MD out that we are horrible, but imagine if we weren’t here. What will happen to the Foundation? Who will heal the injured? Yep. Chaos. The Foundation **does** depend on us. This is only my preference, but we should be kind to all patients that come to the Medical Bay.\n\nAll of this information will be in the guidelines.\nAll right, that’s enough talking. Who wants to go to 999?\n[Trial Nurses Cheer]\nYes! Okay! Let’s go to 999!\n[Everyone gets up and leaves the Infirmary.]\n\n—————\nBrought to you by Piefan11, Principal Doctor",

As I get ready to apply it I take it out and wipe then rub it on The Class-D's arm. “Okay, now I would like you to explain how you feel when I apply this vial.” They give me a thumbs up when I inject the fluid. “I feel tired and weak.” They say as they doze off. \nWe wait the usual thirty minutes and get no response from the subject so we decide to wait an hour, then another hour, We decide to be nice and give them an entire day to rest. The subject does not wake up, so we attempt to forcefully wake them up. “Kreeper get me a stamina vial, quick!” I perform the same procedure and inject the fluid.\n[END LOG]\nADDITIONAL NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS A MESSAGE SENT TO ALL MEDICAL DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL FROM HIGH COMMAND MEMBER ERTINOS.\n\nHello, I would like to notify the Medical Department that following the recent events I now forbid the use of the sedative vial until further notice. We must be strong going forward. We are not measly otters, This is a minor setback. Use of the sedative vial from this point on is to be reported immediately and will result in severe punishment.\nRohkeli and I are working hard to find a future date that we will be able to use this vial again.\nThis announcement should be noted before any further physiological checkups. Have a good day.\n\nWritten by Steambot3.",

Being a physician unlocks a whole new variety of stuff to do. Like doing certain SCP tests, and going to the balcony for the purpose of requesting injured Class-D personnel. You also get to hang out with other medical department members. Being a physician means that you are next to become the next principal doctors. When physician, you are able to help Trial Nurses do checkups. Known otherwise as TNT (Trial Nurse Training.) Physician is the 5th rank in the medical department. \n\n**Section 2, Vials.**\nPhysicians get access to the TPS (Time Process Vial) and the other vials below it. The time process vial freezes time for the subject that is applied with the vial. On our screen, the subject is frozen. But on the subjects screen, they are moving about. I am very fond of the vial because of how it works. The vial usually lasts up to 15 seconds. \n\n**Section 3, Abilities.**\nAs a physician, you can test on different varieties of SCPs. Some examples are SCP 1230, SCP 1205, SCP 999, and SCP 407. We can be escorted to the TSC (Test Subject Containment) balcony for the purpose of requesting injured Class-D personnel as stated in the introduction. We can assist trial nurses in doing checkups which is also stated in the introduction paragraph. \n\n**The End!**\nThank you for taking your valuable time in reading this book about being a physician. \n",

To efficiently execute this duty, Security Juniors and above are given heavy automatic weaponry. \n\nOther departments, such as the Scientific Department or the Medical Department, request Class D personnel daily for testing, medical examinations, and other kinds of activities. Security Juniors and above are tasked with escorting the required amount of CD’s outside of the TSC and they maintain personnel’s safety all along the process. \n\nWhen numerous armed Class Ds come to riot in a coordinated manner, security forces may be overwhelmed. When that happens, a TSC rise is called and additional SD’s are required to back-up and help to contain the rise. But sometimes, per the amount of rioting Class Ds, regular security personnel fail to recontain rises and call a riot. Security personnel will then exit the TSC and enter specific combat formations while being assisted by the Specialized Response Unit. Once the riot is over, the TSC will undergo a lockdown. Rioting Class D personnel are to be put in Solitary Confinement for 10 minutes as soon as they utilize any weapon for the third time.\n",

No, he supposedly had contacts with the Chaos Insurgency and today there would be what Kareen could only call a prison break, even if this wasn’t technically a prison.\n It had been planned for weeks now, with even the most voluntary of the test subjects hanging back, just to try and survive until this wonderful day was upon them. \n Because of the nature of the tests and the staff’s general disregard for their lives, few CDs lasted long but Kareen and her usual gang were some of those who had been here the longest, easily pushing past a year.\n Henry brushed by Kareen’s shoulder as he walked by. Even if he was part of her gang, she normally would have hissed, hating anyone who came into her personal space but today she didn’t, knowing what had been pressed into the palm of her hand without her even looking.\n If the SDs nearby noticed anything unusual, they didn’t react as Kareen made her way back to the kitchens. There he was, already swarmed by CDs needing weapons. He had been here the longest and spent his days dealing arms to anyone that would pay. \n Jax looked up as she came near. She flashed the card Henry had given her and leaned against the wall. Jax slipped a 9mm into her waiting hand.

Kareen slipped back into the general area of the D block and searched for Cheryl, the next person to be getting the card. They had practiced this, they had to get it right.\n Kareen sat at a table already occupied by Henry and JC, waiting for the rest of the group. As the minutes wore on, CDs gradually found seats at any table they could, their arms well hidden. Kareen’s table was somewhere in the middle. When they swarmed the SDs, those at the other tables would be their shield.\n It took the SDs quite a bit of time to notice something was off, but by then, it was already too late. Not a moment too soon, either. The alarm sounded and the lights shone purple. It had begun.\n Before anyone could even blink, the CDs surged in one great, armed wave. The SDs were down in seconds. Kareen was mildly disappointed. She hadn't even had the chance to pull out her gun. Kareen sighed and kicked a body as she walked by it.\n The one way window that was normally in place had been shattered, the jagged edges cutting into Kareen’s palms as she climbed through. Kareen pulled out her gun and made sure it was loaded before continuing. \n Kareen followed the crowd, sticking with her gang. Kareen almost shot their leader when she saw his SD uniform, but realized he must be an inside man, considering he wasn’t currently making an attempt to shoot them. \n They passed through some conveniently open doors and then the real fighting began. Bullets were flying and Kareen didn’t hesitate as she took aim at all those she faced. They moved on once the fighting was over, wasting no precious time.\nKarl, another member of Kareen’s gang, flashed a keycard as he rejoined them, doubtlessly acquired from one of the bodies around them.\n The whining of the metal detectors going off soon filled the air as the CDs streamed through them, all of whom were armed to the teeth with plenty of weapons to set off the alarms.\n It became clear fairly quickly that the one leading them had no clue where he was taking them. At every other intersection, he looked around as if he was lost and Kareen could have sworn they passed SCP 989 three times already. She was getting frustrated with his cluelessness.\n Finally, they stopped walking circles and began to navigate the halls. Kareen was about as lost as everyone else. She wasn’t tested that often, her sense of direction was horrible and all of these hallways looked the same. Kareen made note of what SCPs they passed as they walked, noting ones she knew about or had been previously used to test. One caught her eye and she stopped suddenly, causing Cheryl to bump into her.\n Karl held out his keycard to her. They all understood. Few CDs hadn’t heard of SCP 999, or seen it themselves. With her group standing guard, Kareen scanned the card and made her way inside.\n Despite her usually tough exterior, her heart melted at the sight of the adorable orange blob. Seeming to recognize her, 999 came right up. Kareen grabbed 999’s food dish, thankfully full of food, as persuasion and led 999 out of its room and with it among them, Kareen and her group swiftly caught up with the other CDs.\n The fake SD leading them seemed to have finally found his way, as he led them swiftly to SCP 1162. Kareen smiled, a wicked one. Anyone who hated the foundation that imprisoned them knew what SCP 1162 was.\n The SCP that brings back what was once lost, for an item in return. It was pure luck if Kareen would pull out what she wanted, but she was in luck.  She pulled out her gun that she had smuggled into Area-14, which had disappeared the next day. In return, one of the knives in Kareen’s shoe vanished.\n Few CDs managed to pull out better arms than what they had but those that did had broad smiles on their faces. They were ready to fight.\n And unfortunately for the foundation, they knew what they were doing. All who came their way with weapons drawn were utterly massacred. Kareen herself made more kills than she bothered to count, and she enjoyed every bit of bloodshed. In terms of Kareen’s priorities, they reached the main gate unscathed. They were home free. \n Before Kareen could celebrate, a sharp pain buried itself in her shoulder and with a cry of pain, she went down. She could barely push out the words ‘Leave me and run’, before another bullet found its mark.\n Kareen went down, and she wouldn’t rise again..",

It is, of course, Gandhi who said that the “pen is more powerful than the sword”. This holds true in all aspects of diplomacy.\n\nNow, throughout my time in DEA, I’ve been faced with a myriad of incidents wherein my ability to negotiate, organise and manage myself was pivotal. An example of this was an SD/TOC contest I organised. Dealing with two organisations with a combined total of 1000 people was very difficult for me and my colleagues in TOC/SD to deal with. However, the art of playing your cards right is simple; balance. Diplomacy on roblox is different to that of the real world, as we all share a pivotal interest. The SCPF genre. Using this common interest merits the best result in any regard, and allows for an easier and more common understanding between two parties.\n\nDiplomacy isn’t just balance, though, it’s a smile, cordiality and professionality. When in a position of responsibility, as you naturally are within DEA, being the face of the foundation towards other organisations, it’s pivotal to adopt these 3 traits in order to successfully manage your relations with others.\n\nThis does not just extend to the Department of External Affairs and its affiliates however; in our line of work, that being the fundamental principle of containment, it’s vital to ensure a mutual and common understanding between all departments, as they are all in a state of symbiosis with one another. This state of symbiosis ensures day-to-day operation, and diplomatically understanding this ensures the continuation of our species, your career and the foundation as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, diplomacy is a sharp and powerful tool. It can be used to surgically strike at the heart of your enemy or your friend; and the one who employs it and wields it succeeds, more so than the man with the rifle.\n",

This group is able to host joint raids with the Chaos Insurgency, although their goals are different. Whilst the insurgency seeks to weaponise the SCP anomalies contained by foundation forces, the initiative does not. THI is a religious cult, and is orientated around the praise of god and retrieval of anomalies, primarily due to the belief that the foundation alone should not have the right to sit on such a large cache of anomalies. This is evident in their group description and pseudoreligious ranking structure, with ranks such as “Monk”, “Preacher, “Scribe”, all terms with religious connotations dating back thousands of years.\n\nThe Chaos Insurgency is the larger of the two groups, nearing 4,000 members as of writing. The insurgency is a fragment group that was commissioned in the November of 1951. The insurgency’s primary goal is that of weaponising SCPs and using them for the purposes of unleashing foundational secrets and bringing destruction to the foundation itself. This organisation is far more militaristic than that of its religious counterpart, with ranks such as “Insurgent” labelling the majority of the group.

I didn't expect you to wake up so fast..\" They say.\r\n \"I- who are you..\" You say, still a bit frightened, \"Oh, you have no idea where you are, do you?\" They say, shuffling their hands with a clipboard in them. You\u2019d shake your painful head. \r\n\r\n\"You are in Med-Bay. You were hit in the head on a pipe, as you fell down the stairs.. your friends luckily came by to check up on you.\" You, still shocked, get up, and roam around the Med-Bay's little rooms. \r\n\r\n Once you step out of Med-Bay, the atmosphere turns cold. Something was wrong. Very wrong. You turn around but no one is there. You then feel as the chills go down your spine, as a hand is placed on your shoulder. You turn your head to only see what is a shadowy figure with what was the only thing you could see, was their brown eyes. \"There you are.. no need to run,\" They whisper \"you are safe with me now.\" \r\n",
